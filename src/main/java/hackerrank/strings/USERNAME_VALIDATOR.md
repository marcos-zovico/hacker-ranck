## Valid Username Regular Expression

### Problem
You are updating the username policy on your company's internal networking platform. According to the policy, a username is considered valid if all the following constraints are satisfied:

- The username consists of 8 to 30 characters inclusive. If the username consists of less than  or greater than  characters, then it is an invalid username.
- The username can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). Alphanumeric characters describe the character set consisting of lowercase characters [a-z], uppercase characters [A-Z] , and digits [0-9].
- The first character of the username must be an alphabetic character, i.e., either lowercase character [a-z]  or uppercase character [A-Z].

For example:

| Username       | Validity                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Julia          | INVALID; Username length < 8 characters                |
| Samantha       | VALID                                                  |
| Samantha_21    | VALID                                                  |
| 1Samantha      | INVALID; Username begins with non-alphabetic character |                                 
| Samantha?10_2A | INVALID; '?' character not allowed                     |

### Solution

The regex `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_0-9]{7,29}$` where:

`^{7,29}$` Validate the first rule
> The username consists of 8 to 30 characters inclusive. If the username consists of less than  or greater than  characters, then it is an invalid username.

`[a-zA-Z_0-9]` Validate the second rule
> The username can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). Alphanumeric characters describe the character set consisting of lowercase characters [a-z], uppercase characters [A-Z] , and digits [0-9].

`[a-zA-Z]` Validate the third rule
>  The first character of the username must be an alphabetic character, i.e., either lowercase character [a-z]  or uppercase character [A-Z].
